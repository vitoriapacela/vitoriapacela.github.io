I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the Université de Montréal, supervised by Professor [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/). I also worked for two years at Meta Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) in Montreal as a visiting researcher, supervised by Professor [Pascal Vincent](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pascal-vincent/) and collaborating with Dr. [Kartik Ahuja](https://ahujak.github.io/).
I spent the past summer in New York as a NeuroAI intern at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, working with Professor [David Klindt](https://facultyprofiles.cshl.edu/david.klindt).

I have been conducting research on causal representation learning, independent component analysis, and disentanglement, and out-of-distribution generalization. I'm also broadly interested robustness, safety, interpretability, fairness, and AI for science. 

<!---
I'm looking to learn more about causal abstraction, computational cognitive science, fairness, and [suffering](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/painintl/).

I have a master's degree in data science from the University of Helsinki, where I was supervised by Professor [Aapo Hyvärinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/) and Dr. [Antti Hyttinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ajhyttin/), working on independent component analysis for binary data ([thesis](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/332599)).

I grew up in Brazil and moved to Finland to do my bachelor's in computer science at the University of Helsinki. During my bachelor's degree, I worked mostly on machine learning for particle physics and spent a couple of summers at CERN in Professor Maria Spiropulu's group and Dr. Maurizio Pierini's group.

I practice yoga.
