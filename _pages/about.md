I have master's degree in data science from the University of Helsinki, where I was supervised by Professor [Aapo Hyv√§rinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/) and Dr. [Antti Hyttinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ajhyttin/).

I am broadly interested in unsupervised learning, causal inference and discovery, independent component analysis, deep neural networks, and their applications on the natural sciences. 

During my bachelor's degree, I worked mostly on machine learning for particle physics and spent a couple of summers at CERN in Professor Maria Spiropulu's group and Dr. Maurizio Pierini's group.

I am from Brazil, where I used to participate in national science olympiads in various fields. In particular, the [Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad of Public Schools (OBMEP)](http://www.obmep.org.br/) has had a big impact in my life and career. I am inspired about the social inclusion implications of projects such as OBMEP by disseminating scientific and mathematical knowledge.
