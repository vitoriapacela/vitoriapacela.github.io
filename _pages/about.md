I am a master's student in data science at the University of Helsinki supervised by Professor [Aapo Hyv√§rinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/) and Dr. [Antti Hyttinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ajhyttin/).

I am broadly interested in unsupervised learning, causal inference and discovery, independent component analysis, deep neural networks, and their applications on the natural sciences. In particular, machine learning for particle physics, which I had the privilege to work on as a summer student at CERN.
