I am pursuing a Ph.D. at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the Université de Montréal, supervised by Professor [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/). I have also been working at Meta (FAIR) in Montreal as a visiting researcher, supervised by Professor [Pascal Vincent](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pascal-vincent/).
I am broadly interested in causal representation learning and out-of-distribution generalization. 

I have a master's degree in data science from the University of Helsinki, where I was supervised by Professor [Aapo Hyvärinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/) and Dr. [Antti Hyttinen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ajhyttin/), working on independent component analysis for binary data ([thesis](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/332599)).

I grew up in Brazil and moved to Finland to do my bachelor's in computer science at the University of Helsinki. During my bachelor's degree, I worked mostly on machine learning for particle physics and spent a couple of summers at CERN in Professor Maria Spiropulu's group and Dr. Maurizio Pierini's group.

I practice yoga.
